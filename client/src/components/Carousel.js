The first thing that impressed me was their process, which was clearly documented and thorough, but not cumbersome on the client... My team used machine learning models to understand churn-user behavior and label users as churned or active. When COVID-19 hit mid-project, I fully anticipated these students to take a step back. Instead, they doubled down. My team exceeded the original parameters of the projects. I'm chomping at the bit to hire them back.”

This type of tool can give us a playground to test aspects of our apps and models, ensuring we're building high quality apps for community health and allowing us to start designing our analyses faster. This was a challenging project, and the team really stepped up, delivering a fully functional dataset generator in just a few months. I looked forward to our check-ins, where everyone participated enthusiastically in our discussions and blew me away with the pace of their progress. I'm looking forward to future Data Science Society / Medic collaborations!”
