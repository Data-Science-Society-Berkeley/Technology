      “Over the past semester, the Data Science Society volunteers helped Medic
      develop a tool to synthesize datasets from scratch, given only a Community
      Health Toolkit app's configuration code. This type of tool can give us a
      playground to test aspects of our apps and models, ensuring we're building
      high quality apps for community health and allowing us to start designing
      our analyses faster. This was a challenging project, and the team really
      stepped up, delivering a fully functional dataset generator in just a few
      months. I looked forward to our check-ins, where everyone participated
      enthusiastically in our discussions and blew me away with the pace of
      their progress. I'm looking forward to future Data Science Society / Medic
      collaborations!”

      clearly documented and thorough, but not cumbersome on the client... My
      team used machine learning models to understand churn-user behavior and
      label users as churned or active. When COVID-19 hit mid-project, I fully
